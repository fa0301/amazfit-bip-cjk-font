# amazfit-bip-cjk-font
FontROM builder for Xiaomi Amazfit Bip

This script set converts MS-DOS era bitmap font into Amazfit Bip fontROM.

Currently it supports

* Typical latin bitmap font file
* 844 Dokkaebi font file

# I want other fonts!

You can grab any MS-DOS bitmap font from web and give it a try. (You should edit dkb2bmp.py in that case)

Or, you can try fonts in this repository: https://github.com/perillamint/dkbfnts/

# TODO

Source FLOSS compatible Han bitmap font and Kana bitmap font file and add support for it.
